This is my activist toolkit about the huge amounts of waste we have on Earth.
Our waste results in a variety of environmental and health problems.
In this project, I describe and elaborate on these affects.
Additionally, I include numerous quotes from different organizations and people.
I used a fact generator to give potential solutions to this problem.
